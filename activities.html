If you have never played beach soccer, you will be given a quick run down of the rules and taught how to kick and aim the ball in the sand without hurting yourself.

            <p> An easy way to enjoy the underwater beauty that surrounds our resort is to go snorkeling. All you need is a mask, snorkel, and fins. People of all ages and experience levels will take home wonderful memories about their time in the water with us. Our offers some of the best snorkeling in the world. It is an easy way to enjoy many of the shallow reefs, allowing for easy access. We provide two boat trips per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, which are included in the Snorkel package. Snorkelers may also be interested in taking the one day excursion to the Blue Hole which is regularly scheduled on Tuesdays (weather permitting) This is a full day trip with a picnic lunch at Half Moon Caye Natural Monument where can you see nurse sharks and myriads of brightly-colored reef fish that highlight the reef. Swim out a little further and you might see turtles, spotted eagle rays, seashorses, squid, and moray eels. </p>
